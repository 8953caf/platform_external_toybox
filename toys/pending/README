pending

Commands in this directory are external submissions awaiting review and/or
cleanup before being "promoted" to one of the other directories.

Code in this directory may or may not work, some of the commands here are
unfinished stubs, others just need a more thorough inspection than we've had
time for yet. Everything in here defaults to "n" in defconfig.

Library code awaiting cleanup lives in lib/pending.c

The following commands predate the pending directory, and are awaiting
cleanup but don't live here:

  vmstat, login, du, vconfig, chroot, cut, touch, modinfo, xargs

  lib/password.c
